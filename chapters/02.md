# Chapter 2: Used, Not Loved

*So Sarai said to Abram, “See now, the Lord has restrained me from bearing children. Please, go in to my maid; perhaps I shall obtain children by her.” And Abram heeded the voice of Sarai. Then Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar her maid, the Egyptian, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan.*
— *Genesis 16:2–3*

Hagar’s story bends sharply here. She is no longer just a maidservant in Abraham’s household—she becomes a solution to someone else’s problem. Sarah, desperate for a child, looks at Hagar and sees not a woman with her own dignity, but a vessel, a means to secure her future.

The verbs are striking: *Sarah took… Sarah gave…* Hagar is not asked. She is not invited to speak. She is spoken of, acted upon, and passed between others as though her life were theirs to control. She has no voice in the matter, no agency over her body, no choice in her future.

Her humanity is swallowed by utility.

And this is where her story resonates painfully with ours. Churches can wound in the same way—not always through malice, but through the subtle, steady reduction of people into instruments. You arrive longing to belong, but soon discover you are valued most for what you can do. You can sing, so you’re on the worship team. You can organize, so you’re running children’s ministry. You can give, so you’re praised as a faithful supporter. Your name disappears behind your function.

Sometimes it sounds spiritual: *“God is calling you to step up here.”* But behind the words, it can feel like filling a vacancy rather than discerning a calling. The question of whether this brings life to your soul is rarely asked. The need of the church overshadows the life of the person.

Hagar knew what that felt like. To be taken and given, folded into someone else’s plan without being asked who she was, what she wanted, or how she longed to live.

And if we are honest, many churches in America have baptized this same way of thinking. They speak of vision and mission, of growth and expansion, of “reaching more people for Christ.” But the vision is often shaped not by the Spirit’s leading but by business principles: market research, social trends, engagement metrics. People become “giving units,” “volunteer pipelines,” “attendance numbers.” Souls become statistics.

The story begins to sound familiar: taken, given, used.

You may have felt it yourself—that hollow recognition that your worth is tied to your output. Praised when you perform. Overlooked when you rest. Forgotten when you no longer fit the program. You may have given your gifts freely, only to discover they were consumed by the machinery of vision and growth. You may have offered your time and heart, only to realize you were loved more for your service than for yourself.

This is not love. Love does not reduce people to instruments. Love does not swallow names in the language of strategy. Love never treats a soul as a means to an end.

The ache of being used is not small. It cuts to the core of our humanity, where what we most long for is to be known—not for what we can produce, but for who we are. To be cherished not for our role, but for our personhood.

Hagar’s story, in all its rawness, invites us to name that ache. To admit that it is painful to be seen only as useful. To grieve the ways churches have measured our value by output, attendance, giving, or compliance. And to know that this wound, as deep as it runs, is not the end of our story.

### Blessing

For those who have been taken and given,
spoken of but never truly heard,
may your grief be honored.

For those who have felt their voice silenced,
their dignity overlooked,
their humanity reduced to usefulness,
may your wound be acknowledged.

And may you know today that you are more than a number,
more than a resource, more than a seat to be filled.
You are not a cog in a vision or a solution to a problem.
You are a soul with agency,
a beloved child whose name is spoken by God.

May you walk in the freedom of knowing:
you are not a means to an end.
You are cherished for yourself alone.
You are seen.
