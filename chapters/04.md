# Chapter 4: Driven Out

*So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid is in your hand; do to her as you please.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence. Now the Angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, by the spring on the way to Shur. And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where have you come from, and where are you going?” She said, “I am fleeing from the presence of my mistress Sarai.”*
— *Genesis 16:6–8*

Hagar fled. She left the tents she had lived in, the family she had served, the life she had known. Abraham had turned his face away, handing her over to Sarah’s harshness. With no protection, no voice, no place to stand, she ran.

It is heart-wrenching to walk away from a place that once held meaning, to turn your back on the only community you’ve known because staying has become unbearable. Hagar didn’t run because she wanted adventure. She ran because home had become a place of pain. She ran because survival mattered more than belonging.

And this is the quiet truth many of us know: rarely do people leave church lightly. Most do so only after the weight of mistreatment, misunderstanding, or exclusion has pressed them out. To stay would have been to wither. And so you leave with trembling, with grief, with questions that ache. Because deep down, you know: *if I had been welcomed for who I was, I would have stayed.*

The wilderness is harsh. It strips away the illusion of safety. Familiar rhythms fall silent. Relationships fade. What once grounded you is gone, and all that remains is the ache of displacement.

Hagar, weary and alone, came to rest by a spring of water on the way to Shur. A spring—small, hidden, but life enough to keep her going. And perhaps you know that feeling too. When you leave behind what you’ve known, you grasp for anything, anything at all, that brings comfort.

Maybe for you it has been a book that told the truth you needed to hear. Maybe a conversation with a friend who didn’t judge your questions. Maybe a moment of quiet where God felt closer than you imagined He could outside church walls. These small glimmers are like water in the desert—unexpected grace, nourishment that helps you survive.

And yet, maybe you haven’t found your spring yet. Maybe you are still wandering, your throat dry, your spirit raw from rejection. The desert feels endless, and all you can do is keep walking with your pain. If that is you, let this be said plainly: your thirst is not unseen. Your ache is not ignored. The wilderness you carry in your heart is not meaningless.

To leave a place that once felt like home is no small grief. It is to lose a part of yourself, to wonder who you are apart from the community that shaped you. But hear this: exile is not abandonment. The wilderness is not the end of the story. Even here, even now, God has not turned away.

### Blessing

For those just setting out into the desert,
may you know that your leaving does not make you faithless.
May courage steady your steps as you walk away from what has wounded you.

For those still wandering in the barren places,
may your thirst be honored, your tears be counted,
and may the God who sees you keep watch even when silence feels heavy.

May you find your spring—whether in a word of truth,
a friendship that remains, or a whisper of God’s presence
that meets you where you least expect it.

And when rejection weighs on you like sand in the sun,
may you have strength enough to press on,
until your heart can rest again by waters of life.

You are not abandoned in the wilderness.
You are still seen.
And even here, you are beloved.
