# Chapter 7: Bread and Water

*So Abraham rose early in the morning, and took bread and a skin of water; and putting it on her shoulder, he gave it and the boy to Hagar, and sent her away. Then she departed and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba.*
— *Genesis 21:14*

Abraham rose early, gathered a skin of water and a bit of bread, and placed them on Hagar’s shoulder. That was all. With this meager provision, he sent her and his son away into the desert.

The image is haunting. Abraham, a man of wealth and flocks, could have offered abundance. He could have sent servants, camels, tents, or stores of grain. Instead, he gave the bare minimum. Bread and water—just enough to keep them moving for a while, but not enough to sustain them in the wilderness.

Hagar must have felt the hollowness of it as she walked away. The bread wrapped in cloth, the skin sloshing faintly on her shoulder—she knew it would not last. Every step into the desert was shadowed by the knowledge that what she carried was not enough. The father of her child had resources beyond measure, and yet this was all he chose to give. Was this protection? Was this love? Or was it simply a way to ease his conscience while sending her off to an uncertain fate?

The wilderness soon proved her fears right. The bread was eaten, the water was gone, and the sun beat mercilessly overhead. Her strength failed. Her heart broke. With trembling hands she placed Ishmael under the shade of a bush, unable to watch him die of thirst. She walked away, sat down at a distance, and lifted her voice in weeping. Few scenes in Scripture ache like this one—a mother powerless to protect her child, left with too little to go on.

This is the wound of insufficient care: when those who could have provided more did not. When people with resources, authority, or love offered only a token instead of true sustenance. It is abandonment disguised as provision, and the betrayal cuts as deep as rejection itself.

Many have known this same ache in the church. Sometimes when you bring your weariness, your grief, your hunger for God, what you receive is not presence but platitudes. A quick prayer when you needed companionship. A pamphlet when you needed shelter. Words about faith when what you longed for was love.

It is not always malice. Sometimes it is distraction, or fear, or the busyness of leaders trying to keep the machinery of church running. But the result is the same. You are met with crumbs when what you needed was bread for the journey. You are handed a skin of water when your soul thirsts for living streams. The gesture may be meant as care, but in truth it is a way of sending you on your way—unburdening the institution of responsibility while leaving you to carry the weight.

Perhaps you know this grief. You asked for presence and were met with distance. You asked for shelter and were offered advice. You poured out your heart and received silence. And so you walked away carrying too little, your spirit parched, your heart aching with the realization that you mattered less than you hoped.

This is what Hagar knew: not only rejection, but rejection wrapped in the pretense of care. Bread and water, but not enough to live.

### Blessing

For you who were sent away with too little,
may you know that your worth was never measured
by the crumbs you were given.

For you who lifted your voice in the wilderness,
may the God who hears and the God who sees
meet you with more than enough.

May your hunger be filled not with platitudes but with presence,
not with scraps but with true sustenance.
May living water rise to meet your thirst,
and may you discover that God does not deal in scarcity.

Where others withheld,
may you receive abundance.
Where others offered only words,
may you be embraced with care.
Where you were given bread and water for a desert,
may God set before you a feast of love.

You are not forgotten.
Your needs are not too much.
And the One who sees you will not send you away empty.
