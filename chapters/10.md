## Chapter 10: The God Who Sees

Hagar’s story began in obscurity. She was introduced not by name but by role: *an Egyptian maidservant.* She had no voice in the household, no agency in her own life. She was used to solve someone else’s problem, and when jealousy arose, she was driven out. Twice she was cast away, twice she wandered with too little, twice she wept in the wilderness.

And yet — hers is the story that gives us one of the most tender names for God: *El Roi, the God who sees me.* In her place of invisibility, she became the one who named the One who cannot forget. And in the end, though she never returned to Sarah’s tent, she and her son found life in the wilderness. Ishmael grew strong. God was with him. The rejected were not erased.

For so long, I read this story through the eyes of Abraham and Sarah. They were the chosen ones, the bearers of promise. Hagar was a footnote. But then I entered my own wilderness. I felt what it was to be overlooked, misunderstood, pushed to the margins. And suddenly, Hagar was no longer a shadow — she was a mirror. Her tears became my tears. Her exile, my exile. Her ache, my ache.

The wilderness has a way of teaching you to see differently. When you’ve lived on the outside, you begin to notice the outsiders in the text. You hear their cries more clearly. You discover that God’s presence is not confined to the center, but often lingers on the edges. The God who met Hagar by a spring of water, the God who opened her eyes to a well, is the same God who shows up in places the household of faith would never expect.

Before my wilderness, I might have believed the story told inside the walls — that God’s blessing belonged only to the chosen, to the ones at the center of power. But now I know: God is bigger than the stories churches tell. Bigger than the doctrines we were handed. Bigger than the lines we draw to keep ourselves safe. The Infinite will never be contained.

The real question is not whether God’s arms are wide enough, but whether ours will be. Will we extend our embrace as far as He does? Will we dare to see the ones we once overlooked? Will we welcome those who do not fit the script, trusting that God’s love is always wider than ours?

For you who walk this path of wilderness, know this: you are not alone. Your exile does not erase you. Your lament does not disqualify you. Like Hagar, you are seen. Like Ishmael, you are heard. And like both of them, you are accompanied by a God who goes with you wherever you wander.

The wilderness is not the end of your story. It may yet be the beginning of a new one.

### **Final Blessing**

For you who feel unseen,
may you know the God who sees.

For you who have been cast out,
may you find that exile is not the end,
but the place where God draws near.

For you who thirst,
may your eyes be opened to wells you did not know were there.

For you who wonder if the love of God is wide enough,
may you discover it is always wider than you imagined.

And may your own arms stretch wide —
to embrace yourself with gentleness,
to welcome others with compassion,
and to live as one who has been held
by the infinite, uncontainable love of God.
