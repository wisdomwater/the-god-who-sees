# Chapter 3: When Jealousy Wounds

*So he went in to Hagar, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress became despised in her eyes. Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong be upon you! I gave my maid into your embrace; and when she saw that she had conceived, I became despised in her eyes. The Lord judge between you and me.” So Abram said to Sarai, “Indeed your maid is in your hand; do to her as you please.” And when Sarai dealt harshly with her, she fled from her presence.*
— *Genesis 16:4–6*

Hagar had no agency in what was done to her, and yet she conceived. In the midst of powerlessness, life stirred within her. What should have been a cause for joy became instead the beginning of conflict.

Sarah looked at Hagar’s pregnancy and saw not a gift but a threat. Hagar carried what Sarah longed for, what Sarah could not have. Rather than celebrating the new life growing in her household, Sarah’s heart turned inward. Jealousy took root, and soon hostility followed.

This is a bitter truth: sometimes the very blessings we carry, the very gifts entrusted to us, provoke envy in others. Instead of being welcomed, they are resented. Instead of being affirmed, they are met with suspicion or control.

Hagar’s conception shifted the balance in Abraham’s household. She bore what Sarah could not, and Sarah could not bear the sight of it. Abraham, rather than protecting Hagar, withdrew: *“Your maid is in your hand; do to her as you please.”* And so Sarah mistreated her servant until Hagar fled into the wilderness.

What should have been a moment of joy was twisted into rejection.

The same pattern often plays out in the church. Leaders, like Sarah, can tie their worth to visibility, to who commands the spotlight, to who is perceived as most anointed or successful. When someone else’s gifts begin to flourish, insecurity rises. Instead of joy, competition creeps in. Instead of celebration, suspicion takes root.

Maybe you’ve lived this. Perhaps your gift drew unexpected attention—you led a song that stirred hearts, taught in a way that opened eyes, created something that carried life. Instead of being received with encouragement, you felt the air change. The warmth cooled. The affirmation quieted. The leader who once embraced you seemed distant. What should have been blessed became diminished.

This is the wound of jealousy: when your gift becomes a threat to someone else’s fragile sense of worth.

But jealousy shows up not only around gifts. It also rises when someone carries a new way of seeing God—an insight that stretches the community beyond its comfort. Hagar’s child represented a promise Sarah could not accept. Perhaps it felt too spacious, too uncontrollable, too outside the lines she wanted to draw.

Churches do this too. Sometimes God entrusts a person with a fresh vision of His grace, a new encounter with His presence, a wider understanding of His love. And instead of joy, it stirs fear. Leaders step in as gatekeepers, worried that generosity will loosen their grip on control. The thought that God could move beyond their categories, beyond their theology, feels threatening.

So they push out the voices that open the doors too wide. They label the insights unsafe, liberal, or unbiblical. They protect their box, even if it means silencing the one who has encountered God outside its walls.

Like Hagar, those entrusted with something spacious are often driven into the wilderness.

Perhaps you know this wound. Perhaps you have carried something from God—a gift, an insight, a fire in your spirit—and instead of being welcomed, it was resisted. What should have been celebrated became a threat. What should have been affirmed was dismissed or diminished.

It is a lonely thing, to stand with a promise the church cannot hold. To speak of God’s generosity and feel the room grow cold. To carry a gift from the Spirit and be told it does not belong.

But hear this: the limits of others do not limit the promise of God. Even if your community could not receive it, the gift within you is still real. Even if your church could not bless it, God already has. You are not outside His story. You are not mistaken for carrying what He entrusted to you.

The jealousy of others may wound you, but it cannot cancel the life of God within you.

### Blessing

For those who have carried a gift too large for others to accept,
may you know that the life within you is holy.

For those who have spoken of grace too generous for the gatekeepers to allow,
may you remember that God’s love has always broken through the walls we build.

When others see threat, may you hear God whisper *promise.*
When others turn away, may you feel His gaze remain steady.
When others cannot bless you, may you rest in the blessing already given.

You are not outside of His story.
You are not wrong for carrying what He entrusted to you.
Even if it unsettles those who cling to control—
still, it is life,
and still, it is good.
