# Chapter 5: The God Who Sees

*Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, “You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees”; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?” Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.*
— *Genesis 16:13–14*

Hagar sat by the spring, weary from running, her future uncertain. She had been driven into the wilderness with nothing but her sorrow, but it was there, in that barren place, that God found her.

The angel of the Lord did not meet her in Abraham’s tent or Sarah’s household, but by a lonely spring on the way to Shur. She had been rejected by her community, dismissed by her master, mistreated by her mistress—yet here, she was seen.

And she names Him. No patriarch, no priest, no prophet had done this before. A servant, a foreigner, a woman on the run—she becomes the first in Scripture to give God a name: *El Roi, the God who sees me.*

What others despised, God dignified. What others overlooked, He noticed. The wilderness became holy ground, not because it was safe or familiar, but because it was the place where she finally discovered that she was not invisible to Him.

The message she received was startling. The angel told her she was carrying a son, and that she should name him *Ishmael*—“God hears.” God had listened to her cry in the wilderness. But the promise did not stop with his name.

*“He shall be a wild man;
His hand shall be against every man,
And every man’s hand against him.
And he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.”*

It was not the kind of blessing Abraham had been promised. Ishmael would not be the son of covenant or the center of a chosen nation. His story would be wilder, more contested. He would not live in the security of settled fields or under the control of households. He would be untamed, dwelling in the wide places, always in tension with those around him.

To some, this might sound like a curse. But it was also a kind of gift. Ishmael would not be erased. He would not be domesticated. His life would be marked by freedom and resilience, a strength born in the wilderness.

And isn’t that so often the way? The gifts born outside the familiar walls carry their own kind of wildness. They don’t fit neatly into categories. They are unconventional, untamed, sometimes uncomfortable. But they are real. They are alive. They are strong.

This is the shape of so many modern stories, too. Once you step outside the walls of church life, your faith takes on a wildness. It is no longer polished, domesticated, or neatly explained. When you begin questioning the dogmas handed to you—when you start pursuing God without gatekeepers—your spirit grows untamed.

It can be frightening at first. Without the guardrails of certainty, you may feel exposed, even reckless. Others might look at you with suspicion, labeling you rebellious or “unsafe.” But beneath that accusation lies something holy: your spirit is learning to breathe freely.

Outside the walls, you discover a God who is not confined by statements of faith or denominational boundaries. You hear His voice in places you were once warned against—in poets, in mystics, in traditions you were told were “heretical.” And instead of leading you away from God, these voices awaken you to His vastness.

Wildness is not chaos. It is expansiveness. It is a refusal to let God be boxed in, a willingness to follow Him into the wide places where His presence cannot be contained. Like Ishmael, such faith may always live in tension with the settled and the safe. But it carries strength. It carries resilience. And most of all, it carries the deep knowing that God sees you even when others do not.

Of course, being “wild” comes with a cost. To those who prefer order and predictability, your freedom looks like rebellion. Your willingness to step outside the lines is judged as faithlessness. You may be called unsafe, unteachable, even lost.

It hurts to carry this label, especially when all you are doing is following the God who met you in the wilderness. The rejection stings because it comes from people you once trusted, voices you once depended on for guidance. To be misunderstood in this way leaves a mark.

And yet—even here—the wilderness begins to heal. In the silence where old voices no longer define you, you start to hear God’s voice more clearly. In the emptiness left by rejection, you begin to notice the fullness of His presence that was always there.

The wilderness ache is real. But in that ache, something else awakens: a deeper courage, a wilder strength, a clearer sight. You begin to glimpse what Hagar saw by the spring: that even when the world does not see you, God does. And being seen by Him is enough to sustain you.

### Blessing

For you who wander in the wide places,
may you know that your wildness is not shame,
but gift.

For you who question and seek,
may your untamed spirit become a wellspring of life—
a reminder that God is bigger than the boxes once built around Him.

May you hear, even now, the whisper of the One who listens:
*I have heard your cry. I see your heart.*
And may this knowing steady your steps
when others cannot understand your path.

May the treasures you discover in exile—
the unexpected voices, the new insights,
the presence of God in unlooked-for places—
draw you deeper into His love,
a love wider and more generous than you imagined.

And may you, like Hagar, leave your wilderness
not empty-handed,
but carrying the testimony of a God
who sees, who hears, and who calls you beloved.
