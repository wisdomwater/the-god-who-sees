# Chapter 6: A Second Casting Out

*So the child grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the same day that Isaac was weaned. And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, scoffing. Therefore she said to Abraham, “Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, namely with Isaac.” And the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight because of his son..*
— *Genesis 21:8–11*

It should have been a day of joy. Isaac, the long-awaited child of promise, had been weaned, and Abraham prepared a feast to celebrate. The household gathered, laughter filled the air, and all eyes turned to Sarah’s son. But amidst the celebration, Sarah noticed Ishmael. We do not know exactly what he did—the text simply says he was *scoffing*, or perhaps laughing, playing, teasing. Whatever it was, Sarah’s fury was kindled.

Her demand was swift and harsh: *“Cast out this bondwoman and her son.”* It wasn’t enough for Ishmael to be overlooked; he had to be expelled. Not just Hagar this time, but Ishmael too. The son Abraham had fathered, the child he loved, was to be cut off from his household, erased from the celebration.

Abraham was deeply grieved. The text makes this clear: *“the matter was very displeasing in Abraham’s sight because of his son.”* He loved Ishmael. This was his child too, flesh of his flesh. And yet, instead of defending him, Abraham remained silent. At God’s word, he complied. He rose early the next morning, gathered a skin of water and some bread, and placed them on Hagar’s shoulder. Then he sent her and the boy into the wilderness once more.

It is hard not to feel the sting here. To be rejected once is painful enough. To be rejected again, after tasting a measure of belonging, feels unbearable.

This is a wound many know too well. Sometimes, after time has passed, you gather the courage to return to community. You hope that things have changed, that maybe you will be welcomed with open arms. You long to belong again, to find healing in familiar places.

And sometimes, for a while, it seems possible. There may be moments of joy, flashes of connection, glimpses of acceptance. But then, almost without warning, the old patterns resurface. A word is spoken, a look is given, a decision is made—and suddenly you realize you are not wanted in the way you hoped. The door you thought had opened is slammed shut again.

The devastation of being rejected a second time cuts deeper than the first. It confirms the suspicion that you will never quite belong, no matter how much you give or how hard you try. Like Hagar and Ishmael, you are sent back into the wilderness, carrying only what you can on your shoulders.

Perhaps the hardest part of Hagar’s story is not Sarah’s demand, but God’s response. Abraham hesitated. He loved Ishmael, and the thought of sending him away was unbearable. But then God spoke: *“Whatever Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice; for in Isaac your seed shall be called.”*

It feels shocking, even cruel. The God who had once met Hagar in the wilderness, who had promised her descendants, now seemed to affirm Sarah’s jealousy. The text frames God as siding with Sarah, elevating Isaac as heir and leaving Hagar and Ishmael outside the promise.

This is the voice of insiders telling their story—Israel securing its identity through Isaac’s line. But for those of us who read with Hagar, it raises an ache: does God really only care for the chosen? Does His blessing only flow toward those at the center?

The tension is real. Insiders cling to chosenness while outsiders wonder if they are seen at all. The story as written can make it feel as though God only blesses those inside the walls, only listens to the ones who fit the mold. And yet—even here—there is a quiet thread: *“Yet I will also make a nation of the son of the bondwoman, because he is your seed.”* Ishmael’s story would not be erased. Though diminished, though pushed out, his future remained in God’s hands.

This tension mirrors what so many have felt in the church. Institutions often write the narrative in ways that secure the center and exclude the margins. Sermons and doctrines are shaped to affirm the insiders, not to embrace those who don’t fit. And when someone outside asks for belonging, the answer too often echoes Sarah’s words: *Cast them out.*

Maybe you’ve heard Scripture quoted to justify your exclusion. Maybe you’ve been told that your questions, your identity, or your calling do not align with “God’s will.” Maybe you’ve heard God’s name invoked as though He Himself agreed with your rejection. It is a wound that cuts to the bone.

And yet, like Hagar, you carry a promise that cannot be taken from you. The institution may not bless you. The insiders may not make room for you. But God has already seen you. His blessing follows you into the wilderness, even when you are carrying little more than bread and water.

There is a grief that sits deep when rejection happens not once, but again. The first wound surprises you. The second wound confirms your fears. It says, *You will never really belong here. You will always be the outsider.*

And perhaps the sharpest cut is when God’s own name is woven into the rejection. When leaders insist their decision is “God’s will.” When the blessing of the insiders comes at the cost of your dismissal. The pain is doubled: not only have you been pushed out, but heaven itself feels like it has joined in.

This lament must be named. To cry out against it is not faithlessness—it is honesty. It dares to say: *This hurts. This feels unfair. This makes me question whether God’s love is only for those at the center.* Lament refuses to silence the wound. It holds it open, trusting that God can handle the rawness of our questions.

### Blessing

For you who have been cast out a second time,
may your tears be honored and your grief held close.
It is no small pain to hope for welcome
and to find the door closed again.

For you who have heard God’s name
spoken as though He were against you,
may the weight of that betrayal be lifted,
and may you discover again the God who is for you, not against you.

May the wilderness not feel like abandonment
but like a path where blessing follows.
May you find strength for the road,
bread for the journey,
and the quiet assurance that your story still matters.

You are not erased.
You are not forgotten.
Even when others cannot make room for you,
the God who sees still walks beside you,
calling you beloved,
calling you His own.
