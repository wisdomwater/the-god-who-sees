# Chapter 1: Not Quite Family

*“Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had borne him no children. And she had an Egyptian maidservant whose name was Hagar.”*
— *Genesis 16:1*

---

Hagar enters the story quietly, almost hidden beneath the labels given to her. She is called *Egyptian*—marked by difference. She is called *maidservant*—defined by her position. Only after these descriptions is her name mentioned, and even then it feels like an afterthought.

This is where her story begins: present in Abraham’s household, yet not truly belonging to it. She lived in the tent of promise, close to the covenant, surrounded by prayers and visions of blessing—yet she was never included in that blessing. She was near the family, but not family. Useful, but not cherished.

Many of us know this ache. We’ve walked through church doors week after week, given our time and energy, served on teams, sung the songs, poured ourselves out. And yet, for all our presence, we have not always felt at home.

Sometimes it is because of difference. Our background doesn’t match the dominant culture. Our political views or theology stray from the statement of faith. Our temperament or gifts don’t fit the direction the church is moving. In subtle ways, we are marked as outsiders—welcomed to serve, but not trusted to belong.

Other times it is about power. We are present, but we have no real voice. Decisions are made in rooms we will never enter, by leaders we cannot question. The word *family* is spoken, but our place in that family feels conditional. We can remain so long as we comply, so long as we adapt, so long as we don’t disturb the peace.

It is a strange and painful tension: proximity without belonging, presence without agency. You are in the house, but not in the heart.

This wound is real. It is not weakness to feel it, not immaturity to name it. There is a grief in being known only for your role, your labor, your function—when what your soul longs for is to be known as a beloved child. And in churches where the language of family runs deep, the ache of not being family cuts even deeper.

### Blessing

For those who have stood at the edges of the church family,
serving faithfully yet never truly seen,
may your wound be acknowledged.

For those who have felt the sting of being tolerated but not embraced,
useful but not cherished,
may your ache be honored.

And may you hear this deeper truth:
in God’s family there are no outsiders.
There are no second-class sons or daughters,
no servants kept at arm’s length.

You are wanted.
You are welcome.
You are seen.

The household of God is wide enough for your name,
your voice, your whole self.
And nothing—not exclusion, not silence, not rejection—
can take that belonging away.
