# **Introduction: The God Who Sees**

I grew up in church. Some of my earliest memories are of summer retreats at youth camp, where every evening ended with an altar call. The last night was always the most charged—set apart for those who felt called into full-time ministry. Those who came forward received a special prayer, a blessing, a charge.

I never went forward. I didn’t want to be a pastor or a missionary; I wanted to be an engineer. But even as a teenager, I remember wondering: *Why isn’t there a blessing for ordinary vocations? Where is God’s favor for the rest of us?* A small seed of invisibility took root. Was I somehow less important because I didn’t carry the right kind of calling?

All through junior high, high school, and college, I poured myself into music. Choirs, bands, orchestras—I loved it all. But I wasn’t in the popular crowd. I wasn’t center stage. More often than not, I found myself in the shadows, hanging out with my fellow geeks at the sound board, quietly doing the work no one noticed.

After college, I began co-leading worship at my local church. My style was contemplative, reflective, spacious—more about creating room for God than putting on a show. But my church had Pentecostal roots, and when a megachurch opened down the street, fear set in. The staff worried about losing members. To compete, they leaned into spectacle. Worship became louder, flashier, more like a rock concert. Contemplation didn’t fit anymore.

And so, once again, I felt out of place. I pulled away quietly, and no one seemed to notice when I stopped showing up. That hurt more than I expected. I had given so much, and yet my absence barely registered. I was invisible.

That was the beginning of my wilderness. A decade of deconstruction followed—questioning the doctrines I had been handed, wrestling with the structures we called “church,” wondering why clergy were assumed to hold all the authority. Weren’t we supposed to be following Jesus, not a pastor?

What I discovered, painfully and slowly, is what it feels like to be unseen. To be underappreciated, misunderstood, overlooked. To be on the outside looking in.

And then I stumbled into the story of Hagar. A servant in Abraham’s house, used and discarded by God’s chosen people. Driven into the desert, abandoned, left to die. And yet—it was *there* that she met the living God. It was Hagar, not Abraham or Sarah, who first gave God a name: *El Roi, the God who sees me.*

When I read her story, I recognized my own. I, too, had been pushed to the margins by those who claimed to speak for God. I, too, had cried out in the wilderness. And like Hagar, I, too, found that the God who sees does not forget, even when the church does.

This book is for anyone who has felt that ache. For anyone who has served faithfully but felt unseen. For anyone who has been overlooked, rejected, or cast aside by the very people who were supposed to embody God’s love.

I don’t have neat answers. This isn’t a step-by-step manual for healing. What I can offer is witness: a journey through the story of Hagar and the God who saw her, alongside my own journey of church hurt and wilderness. My prayer is that as we walk through this story together, you will begin to believe what Hagar knew in her bones: *even here, even now, you are seen.*

This is where our story begins.
