# Chapter 9: God Was With the Boy

*So God was with the lad; and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer. He dwelt in the Wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.*
— *Genesis 21:20–21*

The story of Hagar and Ishmael does not end at the well. What began with despair and the fear of death gives way to a quieter, longer story — one of survival, growth, and presence. Ishmael lived. He grew strong in the wilderness, learned to hunt with a bow, and eventually began a family of his own.

The text says simply, *“God was with the boy.”* No grand visions, no fiery miracles, no triumphant return to Abraham’s household. Just a steady, abiding presence that accompanied Ishmael as he made a life in the very place where he had once been cast out.

It is easy to overlook the power of this sentence. God did not abandon Ishmael to the margins. His presence was not confined to Isaac’s story or Sarah’s tent. God went with Ishmael into exile, and there — in the very wilderness that once threatened his life — Ishmael found the ground on which to grow.

Many who have walked away from church — or been pushed out — know something of this story. At first, it feels like exile. You carry the sting of rejection, the weight of loss, and the fear that you will not survive outside the household that once defined you.

But slowly, something shifts. Life continues, even flourishes, beyond the walls you thought were indispensable. In unexpected places you find nourishment: a friendship that welcomes you as you are, a book that speaks with surprising clarity, the silence of a forest trail that feels more like sanctuary than any stained-glass room. These become wells in the wilderness, sustaining your soul when you least expect it.

And as time passes, you begin to grow in ways that might never have been possible had you stayed. Like Ishmael becoming an archer, you discover skills and strengths shaped by your wilderness journey. The ache of rejection remains, but it is no longer the whole story. What once felt like exile begins to look like formation.

Still, there is grief here. It should not have taken rejection for Ishmael to find his place. It should not take exile for us to discover our worth. To be denied belonging in the household — this is a wound that leaves its mark.

And yet, it is not the end of the story. What was meant for loss became the soil of new life. Ishmael grew strong in the very wilderness that once threatened him. His identity was not erased but remade. He became an archer, skilled and resilient, shaped by the landscape of his exile.

So it is for many of us. The pain of being cast out or overlooked is real, but it does not have the final word. Outside the walls, faith becomes more personal, more spacious, less bound by fear. In the wilderness, we find not only survival but transformation.

This is the strange gift of loss: it clears the ground for growth we could not have imagined. What looked like the end reveals itself as a beginning. And we discover that God has been with us all along, turning exile into a place of becoming.

### Blessing

For you who have been sent away,
may the wilderness not be only a place of loss,
but also a place of becoming.

For you who thought your story had ended,
may you discover that exile can be fertile ground,
that God is shaping new life within you even here.

May you find the wells that sustain you,
the friendships that nourish you,
the practices that root you in love.

And may you discover gifts you did not know you carried—
skills honed by trial,
wisdom born of silence,
strength forged in the barren places.

Like Ishmael, may you grow and thrive in the open spaces,
and may you know with unshakable certainty:
God is with you still,
and your story is far from over.
