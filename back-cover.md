When the church you loved no longer saw you, when your belonging slipped away, when faith itself began to crack—where did you turn?

The God Who Sees follows the ancient story of Hagar, the Egyptian servant cast out into the wilderness, and reimagines it through the eyes of those who have known church hurt and spiritual exile.

Through poetic reflections and gentle blessings, this book invites you to find hope in the wilderness—to believe that God’s presence is not confined to the walls of religion, but moves freely among the outcasts, the overlooked, and the weary.

If you have ever felt unseen, unheard, or unworthy in the name of faith, may these pages remind you: the God who met Hagar by a spring of water still meets those who wander today.
